Arkanoid Game

Overview

This project is a Java-based version of the classic Arkanoid game, built with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It showcases modularity, maintainability, and the application of various software design patterns. The game includes multiple levels, score tracking, and interactive gameplay.

Features

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developed with Java Swing for a visually engaging user experience.

Physics-Based Mechanics: The ball interacts realistically with the paddle, walls, and bricks.

Progressive Difficulty: Multiple levels with increasing complexity.

Score System: Tracks player performance across levels.

Game Outcomes: Victory when all bricks are destroyed; defeat when the ball falls below the paddle.

Software Design Patterns: Utilizes Singleton, Factory, and other OOP patterns to enhance reusability and scalability.
